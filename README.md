# Animals Analysis Working Group (AWG)

**OSDR AWGs Overview**  
The [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/) is a science collaboration initiative that provides an open-access data system designed to help scientists discover and access space-relevant datasets to perform primary, secondary, and meta-analyses. OSDR has established the [Analysis Working Groups (AWGs)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/awg/about.html) with the goal of optimizing the metadata, data, and features available to maximize the gain of new knowledge from such rare and complex datasets. The AWGs will assess and improve the effectiveness of the OSDR through intensive utilization of OSDR resources and generate higher-order data. This GitHub repository is dedicated for Animals AWG members to share and collaborate their work and codes.

**ALSDA AWG Overview**  
The Animals Analysis Working Group is comprised of researchers and professors working together with a shared goal of facilitating the use of omics in understanding basic mechanisms and shared molecular responses by which animals and constituent tissues and cells adapt to the spaceflight environment. The group has contributed to the development of consensus analysis pipelines for generating higher-order omics data and cross species analysis of potential mechanisms controlling gene expression changes in response to spaceflight. Animals AWG members meet regularly to share and discuss the latest developments in space biology involving both mammals and non-mammals.
