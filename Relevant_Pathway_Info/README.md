# Pathways/Genes Relevant to Animal Space Biology

This directory holds pathways and associated genes that were found from Animal Space Biology experiments. Explore and share pathways/associated genes from different categories in Animal Space Biology and pull insights that could be applicable to your own projects! We encourage AWG members to review pathways/associated gene lists from other AWGs too. More information followed on each category's directory...
